# React Native Setup with Expo Go

## üìå Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth and efficient development experience, we are using the **Expo Framework** for React Native. Expo simplifies mobile app development and testing by allowing us to run and debug applications directly on a physical device without requiring heavy emulators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before setting up **Expo Go**, ensure you already have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js LTS**  
- **VS Code** (recommended IDE)  
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** operating system  
- A physical device (**Android or iOS**)

## üì± Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development where apps run directly in the browser, mobile development typically requires device emulators. Maintaining these emulators across different device types (e.g., iPhone 7 ‚Üí iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android models) can be resource-heavy and costly.  

**Expo Go** solves this problem by letting you test and run React Native apps directly on your phone. It supports both iOS and Android seamlessly, offering a cost-effective and lightweight alternative to emulators.
